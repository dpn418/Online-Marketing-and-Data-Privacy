					<h2>Who is he and why does the U.S. Government after him?</h2>
					<p>Edward Snowden worked as a technology specialist for the Central Intelligence Agency(CIA) beginning in 2006, where he was trained and then sent to Switzerland and subsequently first exposed to the shady dealings of CIA. He resigned in 2009 from the CIA to work for Dell at a NSA information-exchange site where he worked as an analyst, looking for new ways to dig up information about the electronic activities of China and North Korea. It was at this position where he was first exposed to what was known as "The Program", which involved the mass surveillance of the American public and global communications by the U.S Government. In 2013, he quit his work for Dell to work for Booz Allen, which was also involved in The Program, and he began to plan for the gathering and release of all the secret documents about "The Program". He went public by leaking thousands of secret documents to the media during a secret meet-up in Hong Kong that same year on June 9th. He fled the United States to Russia, where he currently resides as speaks out as privacy advocate against mass surveillance by the U.S. government.</a>

					<h2>"The Program"</h2>
					<p>The United States Government first began The Program after the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, driven by the wave of regret and remorse felt by head U.S. officials and the national security community, the NSA was given a full steam ahead green light. The U.S. government began monitoring phone calls and Internet traffic that came through connections in the U.S. to search everyone for suspicious connections, after being given the secret orders to go ahead by vice-president's lawyer and the NSA's lawyers under President George Bush's authority as commander-in-chief. With this order being kept on a top-secret absolutely need-to-know basis, the NSA immediately mobilized every asset it could towards the mass surveillance of everyone it could. One of these assets was an unused plan called THINTHREAD which could access and sort massive amounts of telephone and e-mail data. Originally THINTHREAD had a privacy filter that would encrypt the data of U.S. citizens unless a warant was served with reasonable suspicion for an individual, that privacy feature was removed and the program was secretly launched by the highest officials with even those who suggested the project being uninformed of its launch. </a>
